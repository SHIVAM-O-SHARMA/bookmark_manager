# Bookmark Manager 
Bookmark Manager is a simple and efficient web application that allows users to save, manage, and organise their favourite website links in one place. Users can add bookmarks with titles and URLs, view their saved bookmarks, and delete them when no longer needed. This helps in keeping all important links easily accessible without the hassle of searching them repeatedly.
